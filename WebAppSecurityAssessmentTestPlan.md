# Web App Security Assessment Test Plan

## Objectives
- Identify and assess vulnerabilities based on the OWASP Top 10.
- Provide recommendations for mitigating identified vulnerabilities.

## Scope
- **Target Application:** [Specify the URL or domain of the web application]
- **Assessment Types:** Automated scanning, manual testing, and code review (if applicable).
- **Testing Environment:** [Specify if testing will be conducted in a production, staging, or testing environment].

## OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities

### 1. Injection
- **Methods and Techniques:**
  - SQL Injection
  - Command Injection
  - NoSQL Injection
- **Tools:**
  - Automated Scanning: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
  - Manual Testing: sqlmap, command injection payloads

### 2. Broken Authentication
- **Methods and Techniques:**
  - Test for weak password policies
  - Session management testing
  - Default or well-known credentials
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) bypass testing
- **Tools:**
  - Manual Testing: Burp Suite, Web proxies
  - Automated Scanning: OWASP ZAP

### 3. Sensitive Data Exposure
- **Methods and Techniques:**
  - Identify sensitive data in transit and at rest
  - Test for improper data storage and exposure
  - Evaluate session token security
- **Tools:**
  - Manual Testing: Web proxies, browser developer tools
  - Code Review: Static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube)

### 4. XML External Entities (XXE)
- **Methods and Techniques:**
  - Test for XXE vulnerabilities by injecting malicious XML payloads
  - Check for file inclusion via XXE
- **Tools:**
  - Automated Scanning: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
  - Manual Testing: Custom crafted XML payloads

### 5. Broken Access Control
- **Methods and Techniques:**
  - Test for access control issues by attempting to access unauthorized resources and data
  - URL manipulation testing
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) bypass testing
- **Tools:**
  - Manual Testing: Browser developer tools, custom scripts
  - Code Review: Manual code review

### 6. Security Misconfiguration
- **Methods and Techniques:**
  - Scan for common security misconfigurations in web servers, databases, and applications
  - Directory traversal and file inclusion testing
- **Tools:**
  - Automated Scanning: Nikto, Nmap
  - Manual Testing: Directory traversal payloads

### 7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Methods and Techniques:**
  - Test for reflected and stored XSS vulnerabilities by injecting malicious scripts
  - DOM-based XSS testing
  - Exploit vectors like cookie theft or defacement
- **Tools:**
  - Automated Scanning: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
  - Manual Testing: Custom XSS payloads, browser developer tools

### 8. Insecure Deserialization
- **Methods and Techniques:**
  - Test for insecure deserialization vulnerabilities by sending malicious serialized objects
  - Exploit deserialization for remote code execution (RCE)
- **Tools:**
  - Automated Scanning: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
  - Manual Testing: Custom payloads

### 9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
- **Methods and Techniques:**
  - Identify and update outdated or vulnerable third-party components
  - Perform dependency scanning
- **Tools:**
  - Dependency Scanning: OWASP Dependency-Check

### 10. Insufficient Logging and Monitoring
- **Methods and Techniques:**
  - Assess the application's logging and monitoring mechanisms
  - Evaluate error handling and incident response
- **Tools:**
  - Manual Testing: Log analysis tools

## Testing Process

1. **Information Gathering**
   - Identify the target web application and environment.
   - Gather information about the application's technology stack and infrastructure.

2. **Automated Scanning**
   - Use automated scanning tools to perform initial assessments.

3. **Manual Testing**
   - Conduct manual testing for vulnerabilities that require human interaction or verification.

4. **Code Review** (if applicable)
   - Review the application's source code for vulnerabilities using static analysis tools and manual review.

5. **Report Generation**
   - Document all identified vulnerabilities, including their severity, impact, and recommendations for remediation.
   - Include supporting evidence (screenshots, logs, code snippets).

6. **Recommendations**
   - Provide recommendations for addressing and mitigating identified vulnerabilities.

7. **Verification and Re-testing**
   - Verify that reported vulnerabilities have been remediated.
   - Perform re-testing to ensure that the vulnerabilities are no longer exploitable.

## Reporting

- Prepare a detailed report containing the following:
   - Executive summary.
   - Vulnerability findings (including CVE identifiers, if applicable).
   - Risk assessment and impact analysis.
   - Recommendations for remediation.
   - Supporting evidence (screenshots, logs, code snippets).
   - Test methodology and tools used.

## Timeline

- Define a timeline for the assessment, including start and end dates for each phase.

## Stakeholder Communication

- Establish communication channels with stakeholders, including application owners, developers, and management, to ensure smooth collaboration during the assessment.
